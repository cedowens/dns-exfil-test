Testing helpers stolen from [benbjohnson](https://github.com/benbjohnson/testing). 

I've copied these around for years. The only mods I've made are
1. change exp,act to got, want and the order to match [go
   conventions](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#useful-test-failures)
2. to export them here. After years of copying them around I find it easier now
   to just include the import and run dep ensure to get them.
